PhD thesis LaTeX files

These are the LaTeX files that compile into my PhD thesis (written in 2013, defended on 2013-06-26). I made two versions: one with most figures in black and white ("thesis marieke toc babel_2.tex") to reduce printing costs, and one version with all color figures in RGB ("thesis marieke toc babelc_2.tex"). Because of limited space on github I won't host the figures here (they are ~100Mb), but I'd be happy to share them. Please contact me if you're interested.
